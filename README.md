# Spotify-End-to-End Data Pipeline Project
This repository demonstrates a fully automated data engineering pipeline that extracts, processes, and analyzes Spotify's Global Top Songs using APIs and AWS services. The project illustrates how modern cloud-native tools can enable seamless ETL workflows and facilitate advanced analytics.

# Project Overview

This project uses the Spotify API to retrieve real-time music data, processes and transforms it, and prepares it for analytics. Key components include automated extraction, transformation, storage, and querying capabilities, all built on AWS services.

# Pipeline Architecture

### Data Extraction:
Extract Spotify Global Top Songs via Spotify API. Convert the data into structured formats using Pandas. Deploy data extraction logic on AWS Lambda, enabling automated and scalable extraction workflows.

# Data Storage:
### Store extracted data in AWS S3:
Raw Data: Segmented into to-process and processed folders for easy management. Transformed Data:Organized into structured tables (songs, artists, albums).

### Data Transformation:

Implemented a transformation Lambda function (spotify-transformation): Automatically triggered on new uploads to the to-process folder. Transforms raw data into relational tables ready for analytics. Moves processed data to the appropriate S3 folder.

# Data Cataloging and Analytics:

AWS Glue: Automatic schema detection and data catalog creation.

AWS Athena: Serverless SQL querying for analytics.

Spotify API: Data source for global top songs.

Python: Data extraction and transformation using Pandas.

AWS Lambda: Serverless functions for automation of extraction and transformation.

AWS S3: Storage of raw and processed data.

# Project Features

Automated ETL Pipeline: Fully automated pipeline triggered by events.

Scalable Design: Leverages AWS Lambda for cost-effective and scalable computation.

Data Organization: Logical folder structure in S3 for easy data management.

Real-Time Transformation: Processes data as soon as it is ingested.

Advanced Querying: Use Athena for SQL-based queries and insights.
